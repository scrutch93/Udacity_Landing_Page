# Description/ User Story

The goal of this project was to create a webpage that has a navbar that is dynamically created by solely javaScript.
When the user selects a section in the navbar, the page will then scroll to the corresponding section within the viewport.
When the section is being viewed within the viewport, the active section will be defined in the viewport of the console.
When the section is viewed, the corresponding navbar tab text will highlight.
